3d for Minecraft

> **Warning**
> 
> Requires [ClothConfigAPI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config/files); [ModMenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu/files)

Red-cyan by default

#### Options (in ModMenu):


- Eye separation (Can be measured against a mirror by closing one eye and aligning openEye-0-openEye, then changing the eye and reading the value);
- Eye angle (set to $2⋅tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{distance between eyes}}{2⋅\text{distance to monitor}}\right)$ for best experience)
- Glasses RGB (FTT for red-cyan, TTF for blue-yellow, etc)
- Crosshair rendering (as it is very distracting to aim with two of them)
- Grayscale fog (overworld one is blue, nether is red - both very bad for glasses) 


Nether has a very bad color scheme, so play a few hours in overworld first.
Recommended with something like https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/pack-and-white to get used to the unusual eye position in Nether. You really should play around 2 days with it
Don't look at diamonds/lava until you feel confident with colors
