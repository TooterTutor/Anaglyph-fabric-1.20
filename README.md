# Anaglyph-fabric
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anaglyph-fabric/files

3d for Minecraft

$\color{red}{\text{Requires}}$ [ClothConfigAPI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config/files); [ModMenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu/files)

$\color{#f88}{Red}\text{-}\color{#0ff}{cyan}$ by default

#### Options (in ModMenu):


- Eye separation (Instructions below)
- Eye angle (set to $2⋅\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{distance between eyes}}{2⋅\text{distance to monitor}}\right)$ for best experience)
- Glasses RGB ( $\text{F}\color{#0ff}{TT}$ for red-cyan, $\color{#ff0}{TT}\color{#000}{}\text{F}$ for blue-yellow, etc)
- Crosshair rendering (as it is very distracting to aim with two of them)
- Grayscale fog (overworld one is blue, nether is red - both very bad for glasses) 


Nether has a very bad color scheme, so play a few hours in overworld first.
Recommended with something like https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/pack-and-white to get used to the unusual eye position in Nether. You really should play around 2 days with it
Don't look at diamonds/lava until you feel confident with colors
